# PiSQuiz
PiSQuiz is a project that I am most proud of, although there is no final version yet. 
Since I am not a supporter of the current government in Poland, I created a quiz with questions about various offenses of our government. 
To increase the credibility of the questions, a link to the source of the page appears with each question after the correct answer is given.
In addition, in the background there is a song that refers to the actions of the authorities. There are supposed to be 100 questions to ask, and more songs. 
I intend to publish the application in the Play store before the parliamentary elections, which may convince, especially the young generation, not to vote for the current government.
Open  and download,,PiSQuizPresentation.mp4" to see how app works :)
